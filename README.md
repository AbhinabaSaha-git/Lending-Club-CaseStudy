# Lending-Club-CaseStudy

Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
- The objective of the analysis is to identify risky loan applicants who can default in future,
  then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.
- Lending club is the largest online marketplace ,facilitating personals loans,business loans
  etc. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans
- Assesing whether an applicant will default the loan or not so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.
- Dataset was from banking domain that contains the customers demographic and banking related informations. 


## Conclusions
- We have noticed high income makes the DTI low so , focusing on good monthly income is always a good idea.
- For less employment duration, lesser monthly income and low grades applicants it’s a good idea to get the principal
  amount in the initial instalments first so we can have less chances of loss.
- Customers who requires loan for debt consolidation purpose should be ignored.
- Funding huge amount with high interest to applicants with low income (less than 10000) will not be a good idea.
